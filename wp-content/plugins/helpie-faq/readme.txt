You can drag or drop to order the FAQs.
 
## FAQ for WooCommerce ( Woocommerce FAQs / Product FAQs )
An FAQ tab can be created on WooCommerce product pages and FAQs can be added and edited for individual WooCommerce products. It makes it easy to answer your customer's common questions on the product pages themselves.
It can also be used for non-FAQ content for WooCommerce accordion tabs. You can add FAQs to all WooCommerce products or specific product categories using **Helpie FAQ Pro**.
