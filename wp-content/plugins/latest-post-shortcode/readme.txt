== Description ==
The "Latest Post Shortcode" helps you display a list or grid of the posts or pages in a page/sidebar, without having to code or know PHP. You can embed as many shortcodes in a page as you need, each shortcode configured in a different way. The shortcode for displaying the latest posts is [latest-selected-content] and can be generated very easy, the plugin will add a block or a shortcode button in the editor area.
The "Latest Post Shortcode" is configurable and allows you to create a dynamic content selection from your posts, pages and custom post types by combining, limiting and filtering what you need. The output parameters are extremely flexible, allowing you to choose the way your selected content will be displayed.

You can write your own "read more" replacement, choose wether to show/hide featured images, you can even sort the items by a number of options, paginate the output (also AJAX pagination).
This plugin should work with any modern theme.

When used with WordPress >= 5.0 + Gutenberg, the plugin shortcode can be configured from the LPS block or from any Classic block, using the plugin button.

== Demo ==
https://youtu.be/er5wnGolfw8

= Usage example =
`[latest-selected-content perpage="4" showpages="4" display="title,date,excerpt-small" chrlimit="120" url="yes" linktext="Read more" image="thumbnail" elements="3" css="four-columns tall as-overlay light" type="post" status="publish" orderby="dateD" show_extra="ajax_pagination,light_spinner,pagination_all,date_diff,category,hide_uncategorized_category"]`

or simply

`[latest-selected-content limit="4" type="post" display="title,content-small" chrlimit="50" image="full" elements="0" css="two-columns" taxonomy="category" term="samples" orderby="dateA"]`

Starting with version 8.0, the plugin has a new UI and some new cool features. With this version, the output of the shortcode can be configured also as a slider, with responsive and different modes options. In this way, if you previously used the Latest Post Shortcode Extension, this is no longer needed, the plugin handles all by itself.

Starting with version 7.0, the plugin implements new hooks that allows for defining and managing your own custom output, through your theme or your plugins. The new hooks are:
- `lps_filter_tile_patterns` and `lps_filter_display_posts_list` - allows you to add your custom patterns
- `lps_filter_use_custom_tile_markup` - allows you to define your custom tile markup
- `lps_filter_use_custom_section_markup_start` and `lps_filter_use_custom_section_markup_end` - allows you to control the shortcode markup that is shown before and after the tiles block.
